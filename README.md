UnityRegistrationByConvention
=============================

This repository is a playground for testing registration by convention in [Unity](https://unity.codeplex.com/) because I struggled to find useful, non trivial examples.

To keep things as simple as possible the project is uses the internet application .NET MVC template. The registration by convention examples are in [Bootstrapper.RegisterTypes](https://github.com/philjhale/UnityRegistrationByConvention/blob/master/UnityRegistrationByConvention/Bootstrapper.cs#L29)
